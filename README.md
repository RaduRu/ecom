This is an e-commerce platform where a user, whether logged in or not, can add products to the cart and view them in more detail with their descriptions.
After adding products to the cart, the user can view a checkout page where they can proceed to pay for the order by entering the shipping details. 
Additionally, functionalities for login (allowing the user to access their account), logout (to log out of the account), and registration (to create a new account) have been implemented.
